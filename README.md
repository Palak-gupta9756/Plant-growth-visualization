# 🌱 Plant Growth Visualization using Power BI

This project focuses on visualizing plant growth data using **Power BI** to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The visualization helps in monitoring plant development under various environmental conditions and facilitates data-driven decision-making in agriculture, botany, or environmental research.

## 📊 Project Overview

The Power BI dashboard integrates real-time or historical data on plant growth metrics such as:

- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Humidity & Watering frequency
- ☀️ Light intensity/duration
- 🌱 Plant height & leaf count over time
- 📆 Growth stage tracking (e.g., seedling, vegetative, flowering)

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize multi-variable data affecting plant growth.
- Identify environmental factors with the most influence on plant health.
- Enable predictive insights using time-series growth patterns.
- Provide user-friendly, interactive dashboards for research or agricultural use.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Interactive filters for date ranges, plant types, and growth stages
- 📈 Line and bar charts for visualizing trends over time
- 🧩 Pie/donut charts for categorical distributions
- 🌍 Geo maps (if location-based growth data is included)
- 📋 Summary cards for average growth metrics

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Microsoft Excel / CSV (for data source)**
